# Demo of Rest Assured for testing REST APIs

This demo tests against the fake api at: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

## To Create a Project Like This From Scratch
- Install `gradle`.
- Create project folder, in this case `rest-assured-demo` and `cd` into it.
- Run `gradle init --type java-library`. I selected defaults for all the prompts except Source Package, which I named `org.example`.
